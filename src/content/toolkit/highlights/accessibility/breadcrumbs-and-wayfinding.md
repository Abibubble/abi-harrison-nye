### What is it for?

Breadcrumbs are a secondary navigation system that shows a user's current location within a site's hierarchy. Their purpose is wayfinding: helping all users understand where they are, how they got there, and how to navigate back to parent pages. This is essential for users with cognitive impairments and for screen reader users who need context to orient themselves.

Inaccessible wayfinding creates significant barriers. Users get 'lost' and disoriented, screen reader users lose context, and it increases the cognitive load for everyone. This forces users to rely on the 'Back' button or start their entire journey over.

### How to support it

To ensure your breadcrumbs are accessible, build them with semantic HTML.

Wrap them in a \<nav\> element with an aria-label="breadcrumb". This tells screen readers what this landmark is

Use an ordered list (\<ol\>) because breadcrumbs represent a sequential path

The last item (the current page) should not be a link. Identify it with the aria-current="page" attribute

Hide visual separators (like \> or /) from screen readers by wrapping them in a \<span\> with aria-hidden="true"
